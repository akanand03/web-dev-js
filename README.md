This JavaScript code creates an interactive button on a web page. When the button is clicked, it triggers a function that changes the appearance or text of the button. This simple interaction adds a dynamic element to the webpage, enhancing user engagement and interactivity.

You can customize the button's behavior and appearance by modifying the code to suit your specific needs. This code serves as a foundational example for creating interactive elements on a website using JavaScript.
